Tried to use the following code to make an update to an existing field:

app.post('/species/:id', function(req, res){
  //query that stores the updated information for that instance
  Animal.update({_id: req.params.id}, {$set: function(err, animals) {
    if(err) {
      console.log('something went wrong');
    } else {
      res.redirect('/', animal);
      }
    }
  })
})

Received the following error:
    Error: Invalid atomic update value for $set. Expected an object, received function

Fix #1
  - since it's expecting an object and we threw it a function, we can take the text
  input value and save it to that specific id
    - however, i don't know how to handle the error from here

Result
  app.post('/species/:id', function(req, res){
    //query that stores the updated information for that instance
    Animal.update({_id: req.params.id}, {$set:
      {Animal: req.body.Animal}
    }, function(err, result){
      res.redirect('/');
    })
  })
